title: Karabiner

If there is one thing that changed my life the most, it's [Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements).

My [previous wiki had good overview of how I use Karabiner](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner).

My latest config is [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config/blob/main/karabiner/karabiner.edn). It uses [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) and is quite readable.
