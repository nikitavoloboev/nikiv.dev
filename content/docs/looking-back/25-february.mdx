## February 16

Need to move a lot faster.

Have some traffic but none of it is monetized. So I'm broke.

Ship, ship, ship.

## February 23

Been busy. There is one secret project that was released early this month. And now I am releasing [gpton.co](https://gpton.co) as mini app.

It's early in works but it's exciting. Gaming platform on both Telegram mini app and soonish web. P2P chess and other games.

This is early release, will do some touches on it and I want to get [solbond.co](https://github.com/solbond/solbond) out asap.

So much work.

It's not yet end of month but I am on nearly 800 commits now. Not that commits are a good metric but it's something.

I want to try get it to 1500 or so commits next month. And 3000 closer to April. Quality commits too. Ship faster. Share more. Is the goal.
