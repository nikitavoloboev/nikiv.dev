## March 2

Joined [Jazz](https://jazz.tools) part time. Will work on sync and better dashboard amongst few other things.

Super excited and thrilled about this. It's great piece of tech that I am already starting to use for my PrePrompt tool (similar to [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com)).

Also Severance is absolutely amazing.

## March 9

Diaries are great. This public one I do every Sunday but I write into personal diary nearly every day.

This week I was working on Jazz, trying to make sense of it better alongside getting projects I have on the side better.

## March 16

More Jazz and code. Plus lots of tool optimizing. Will write about it soon.

Just insane non stop amount of work. That's all.

Have ideas and going towards automating more and more of it away.

## March 30

Started work on [gen](https://github.com/genxai/gen) + more Jazz.

Still in Santander. Want to move but don't have the finances so grinding hard till then.
