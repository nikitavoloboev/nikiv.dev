title: My file system
---

My file system looks like this: (as output from [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)):

<Callout>
  most of this structure is messy and needs cleaning but it works for me for now
</Callout>

## ~/src

```
alfred  api  base  bolt  browser  c  cli  config  deno  elixir  games  go  help  kotlin  lean  mojo  moonbit  nikiv.dev  nix  ocaml  odin  org  other  pause  py  raycast  rust  scala  snippets  swift  ts  ui  zig
```

Majority of `~/src` is open source and is shared and explained in [GitHub bio](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev)

## ~/

```
ai            bin      contexts  Desktop    done       gh     Library  media   notes     past      pr           run                       sites  test-ledger  ui          xcode
Applications  bugs     data      do         Downloads  go     lisa     Movies  OrbStack  Pictures  Public       'Screen Studio Projects'  src    todo         use         yandex-cloud

bike          ComfyUI  deps      doing      forks      la     Logs     new     other     Postman   rover        share                     test   try          x
```

## ~/Documents

```
apps  books  mmkv  sort
```

Above is like this only as I try to structure what's in `sort` folder (old `~/Documents`) better.

```
apps  audio  audio-books  books  design  docs  huggingface  images  invoices  la  learn  music  org  other  papers  pdf  personal  presentations  process  processing  slideshow  tax  use  video  web-archives  zoom
```
